Abstract
Intraparty preference voting systems offer different incentives 
for candidates to cultivate a personal vote, but little is known 
about  how  the  candidates'  policy  positions  affect  their  elec-
toral success in intraparty competition. This article analyses 
the  effect  of  candidates'  ideological  positions  and  personal 
attributes on their preference vote share in the 2015 and 2019 
Swiss Lower House elections. We used candidate survey data 
combined with official election statistics. Our findings demon-
strate that the ideological distance between candidates' posi-
tions and their party's median position is of minor importance 
for  their  electoral  success  when  compared  to  their  personal 
attributes. However, ideological distance between candidates 
and their party's median position reduce their preference vote 
share.
Zusammenfassung
Innerparteiliche  Präferenzwahlsysteme  bieten  unterschiedli-
che Anreize für Kandidaten, eine personenbezogene Wahl zu 
fördern. Allerdings ist wenig darüber bekannt, wie die poli-
tischen Positionen der Kandidaten deren Wahlerfolg im inner-
parteilichen Wettbewerb beeinflussen. Dieser Artikel analysiert 
die Auswirkung der ideologischen Positionen und persönlichen 
Eigenschaften der Kandidaten auf ihren Vorzugsstimmenanteil 
bei den Schweizer Nationalratswahlen 2015 und 2019. Hierzu 
werden  Daten  aus  Kandidatenbefragungen  in  Kombination 
mit offiziellen Wahlstatistiken verwendet. Unsere Ergebnisse 
zeigen, dass die ideologische Distanz zwischen den Positionen 
der  Kandidaten  und  der  Medianposition  ihrer  Partei  weni-
ger wichtig als für ihren Wahlerfolg ist als ihre persönlichen 
Eigenschaften. Die ideologische Distanz zwischen den Kandi-
daten  und  der  Medianposition  ihrer  Partei  verringert  jedoch 
ihren Vorzugsstimmenanteil.

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

Résumé
Les systèmes de vote préférentiel offrent différentes incitations 
aux  candidats  pour  cultiver  un  vote  personnel,  mais  on  sait 
peu de choses sur la manière dont les positions politiques des 
candidats affectent leur succès électoral dans la compétition 
intra-parti. Cet article analyse l'effet des positions idéologiques 
et des attributs personnels des candidats sur leur nombre de 
votes  de  préférence  lors  des  élections  à  la  Chambre  basse 
suisse de 2015 et 2019. Nous utilisons des données d'enquête 
sur  les  candidats  ainsi  que  des  statistiques  électorales  offi-
cielles. Nos résultats démontrent que la distance idéologique 
entre les positions des candidats et la position médiane de leur 
parti est moins importante pour leur succès électoral que leurs 
attributs personnels. Cependant, la distance idéologique entre 
les candidats et la position médiane de leur parti réduit leur 
nombre de votes de préférence.

Electoral systems may provide candidates with different incentives and instruments to cultivate a 
personal  vote  (Carey  &  Shugart,  1995).  Open-list  proportional  representation  (PR)  systems  are  a 
sort of a compromise in the continuum of personal vote seeking versus party vote seeking incen-
tives (Crisp et al., 2013). In open-list systems, voters are allowed to choose among a party's candi-
dates. However, candidates' preference votes are pooled at the party level. Seats are first distributed 
among parties; then, within each party list, preference votes entirely determine which candidates are 
elected. One consequence of intraparty preference voting (IPV) is that candidates from the same party 
must compete against each other in order to be elected. In those races, candidates' personal attributes 
(such  as  gender,  age,  incumbency,  electoral  experience  and  localness)  become  relevant  factors  in 
the intraparty election, as a number of studies have shown (Valdini, 2012, 2013; Dahlgaard, 2016; 
Jankowski, 2016; Passarelli, 2019). The literature has also found that the position of candidates on 
the ballot affects their chance of attracting preference votes (Darcy & McAllister, 1990; Miller & 
Krosnick, 1998; Lutz, 2010; Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; Blom-Hansen et al., 2016; Mustillo 
& Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; Söderlund et al., 2021).

The impact of candidates' ideological positions on their electoral success in intraparty competition 
has received less attention. One reason for this relative lack of attention in the literature is that the 
ideological positioning of candidates is assumed to be of low importance in intraparty competition 
(Katz, 1980; Isotalo et al., 2020). The second reason points to data availability. It is a time consum-
ing and laborious task, but data on the personal attributes and ballot position of candidates can be 
gathered from official statistics, newspapers and parties' websites. Obtaining data on the political 
and ideological positions of individual candidates is a more complicated task. This requires specific 
candidate surveys or voting advice applications (VAAs), which were not available until recent years. 
Nevertheless, looking into the role of ideology is important to better understand what explains the 
electoral success of individual candidates in intraparty competition. It also sheds light on how citizens 
use preferential voting (van Erkel, 2021).

Three recent works (Isotalo et al., 2020; van Erkel, 2021; von Schoultz & Papageorgiou, 2021) 
have  analysed  the  effect  of  candidates'  political  stances  on  their  preference  vote  share.  However, 
they obtain contrasting results. On the one hand, studies by Isotalo et al. (2020) and von Schoultz 
and Papageorgiou (2021), based on the Finnish open-list PR system, demonstrate that candidates' 
ideological positions matter for their electoral success, and that candidates who take on party-moderate

positions are more successful than their co-partisans deviating from the party median. Additionally, 
Isotalo et al. (2020) analysed whether the effect of ideological position is contingent on the ideological 
position of the candidates' parties. The findings indicate that the direction of candidates' ideological 
distancing matters, but only for candidates within centre, right-wing, and traditional, authoritarian, 
nationalist parties. On the other hand, the study by van Erkel (2021), based on the Belgian flexible 
list-PR system, finds that candidates' ideological positions with respect to their party line has no effect 
on the number of preference votes candidates receive.

In  a  contribution  to  this  literature,  this  article  examines  the  impact  of  candidates'  ideologi-
cal positioning and their personal attributes on their preference vote share in Swiss Lower House 
elections. The  study  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  open-list  PR  systems  are  complex  electoral 
settings for both voters and candidates; therefore, voters are likely to rely on information shortcuts 
to discriminate among a party's candidates (Brockington, 2003; Valdini, 2012, 2013; Marcinkiewicz 
& Stegmaier, 2015; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; Muraoka, 2021). Furthermore, the Swiss 
open-list PR system provides voters with broader freedom of choice over candidate selection than 
other open-list PR systems. It also poses some additional information demands on voters. In elections 
to the Swiss National Council (the Lower House), voters can cast multiple preference votes (as many 
as there are seats to fill in their constituency) and distribute them among candidates from multiple 
parties. Districts vary greatly in their magnitude. In the 2019 Swiss election, district magnitude in 
multimember constituencies ranged from two to 35 seats. Therefore, voters were permitted to support 
up to two candidates in the smallest district and up to 35 candidates from the same or different party 
lists in the largest constituency. However, the Swiss electoral system does not appear to be as complex 
as those where preference voting is compulsory and without pre-printed party ballots (e.g. the Finnish 
case). Under the Swiss open-list PR system, the casting of a preference vote is not compulsory. Addi-
tionally, Swiss voters are provided with pre-printed party ballots along with blank ballot papers, but 
parties use different methods to arrange their electoral lists.

The Swiss system therefore provides a good case study to find answers to the following ques-
tions: In an open-list PR system, which is more relevant for candidates' individual chance of getting 
elected—their own personal attributes or their ideological/policy position? In this kind of setting, 
with multiple preference votes, is it more advisable for individual candidates to position themselves 
ideologically closer to their party's median position in order to get more preference votes or to deviate 
from it? This article draws on previous works (Isotalo et al., 2020; van Erkel, 2021; von Schoultz & 
Papageorgiou, 2021). It expands the scarce empirical evidence on the electoral effect of candidates' 
ideological position in intraparty competition by analysing the Swiss open-list PR system. An addi-
tional advantage of our study is that we use candidate survey data instead of VAAs.1

INCENTIVES TO CULTIVATE AN IDEOLOGICAL VOTE-EARNING 
STRATEGY IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

In most European countries, voters are permitted to choose among a party's candidates in parliamen-
tary elections. There are different types of IPV-PR system, however: flexible lists, open lists, and the 
single transferable vote (STV), each of them offering different incentives for candidates of the same 
party to compete against each other to get elected. As several studies have underlined, the incentives 
IPV provides for intraparty competition diverge according to (i) whether preference votes are pooled 
at the party level; (ii) whether preference voting is optional or compulsory; (iii) whether there are 
one or more preference votes available to voters; (iv) whether preference votes fully determine the 

1 The study by van Erkel (2021) also uses candidate survey questions. The use of VAAs to analyse candidates' electoral strategies has two 
important limitations. Firstly, candidates' responses to questions are not anonymous, which may bias their answers. Secondly, parties may 
provide guidelines to candidates on their responses to VAAs questions (Isotalo et al., 2020). Self-selection and misreporting are the most critical 
problems for candidate surveys (Bundi et al., 2018), although they may also affect VAAs.

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

allocation of seats within party lists; (v) whether lists are alphabetical or party ordered; (vi) the length 
of party lists; (vii) the number of incumbent candidates running; (viii) the electoral support for the 
party list in which each candidate runs (Carey & Shugart, 1995; Miller & Krosnick, 1998; Lutz, 2010; 
Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; Renwick & Pilet, 2016; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; 
Muraoka, 2021; Söderlund et al., 2021).

In open-list PR systems, a vote for an individual candidate is also a vote for the party. However, 
preference votes for candidates entirely determine their order of election within each party. Therefore, 
to get elected, candidates must try to differentiate themselves, individually or in sub-groups, from their 
co-partisans. They also face the challenge of striking a balance between their personal reputation and 
that of their party (Crisp et al., 2013). In systems using open-list PR, candidates can cultivate a personal 
vote by relying on their own political message and/or their personal attributes (Katz, 1980; von Schoultz 
& Papageorgiou, 2021). However, the literature on voting behaviour suggests that the two strategies are 
not equally effective. It outlines that the ideological positioning of candidates on a party list may be 
less relevant than their personal attributes (Isotalo et al., 2020; von Schoultz & Papageorgiou, 2021) or 
not relevant at all for their electoral success (van Erkel, 2021). These studies are based on the assump-
tion that open-list PR systems are complex electoral settings (Brockington, 2003; Valdini, 2012, 2013; 
Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; Muraoka, 2021). They pose 
a higher cognitive burden on voters than closed party lists, by asking voters to choose among a party's 
candidates. Additionally,  intraparty  competition  involves  a  low-salience  race.  Electoral  competition 
among candidates for the same party is of lower importance to voters than competition among parties. 
Under these conditions, voters have a limited capacity or willingness to acquire detailed information 
on each candidate's stance on political issues. Moreover, voting decisions among a party's candidates 
based  on  their  policy  positions  are  highly  demanding  in  terms  of  information  processing  (Lau  & 
Redlawsk, 2006), so incentives for voters to gather this type of information about candidates is expected 
to be low (von Schoultz & Papageorgiou, 2021). Voters thus have incentives to use shortcuts such as 
candidates' personal characteristics and other information cues available on the ballot to discriminate 
among a party's candidates (Brockington, 2003; Valdini, 2012, 2013; Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; 
Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; Muraoka, 2021). Candidates' names on the ballot contain polit-
ically useful cues for voters, such as name recognition, gender and ethnicity. Extensive research has 
demonstrated that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their co-partisans at the nomination 
and/or voting stage (Dahlgaard, 2016). Firstly, incumbents are usually advantaged for reselection by 
their political parties in the nomination process (Golden & Picci, 2015; Fiva & Røhr, 2018). Apart from 
name recognition on the ballot, incumbent candidates may also have more media attention, receive more 
endorsements, and have easier access to campaign finance than newcomers during the voting stage. 
They may also benefit from their previous electoral campaign and parliamentary experience. Candi-
dates' gender is also considered to be easily available information on the ballot that may open the door 
to stereotypes concerning their qualifications and positions on issues (Valdini, 2012). Gender stereo-
types can be used as voting cues in IPV electoral settings, but these are not necessarily disadvantageous 
for female candidates (Sanbonmatsu, 2002), and they may, at an aggregate level, produce any given 
result (Wauters et al., 2010; Kunovich, 2012; Valdini, 2012; Spierings & Jacobs, 2014; Allik, 2015; 
Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020). If secondary information 
on candidates provided by the ballot is of little help, voters may rely on tertiary information, such as 
their ballot position (Brockington, 2003). A large number of studies demonstrate that the order in which 
candidates are listed on the ballot has an effect on their number of preference votes, finding that candi-
dates receive fewer nominative votes the lower they appear on the party list (Darcy & McAllister, 1990; 
Miller & Krosnick, 1998; Lutz, 2010; Spierings & Jacobs, 2014; Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; 
Blom-Hansen et al., 2016; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020; Ragauskas, 2021).

Drawing on these arguments, we generate our first hypothesis:

H1: Candidates' personal attributes will have a stronger effect on their electoral success 
than their individual policy positions.

Even  if  the  political  message  is  expected  to  be  of  little  importance  in  intraparty  competition,  the 
question that arises then is in what way the ideological position of candidates affects their number of 
preference votes. In open-list PR systems, is it more promising for individual candidates to position 
themselves ideologically closer to their party's median position or to deviate from it? The scarce liter-
ature on how candidates' policy positions affect their success in intraparty competition suggests that a 
deviating ideological position could have either a positive effect on their number of preference votes or 
a negative impact on candidates' electoral outcomes (Katz, 1980; Isotalo et al., 2020; van Erkel, 2021; 
von Schoultz & Papageorgiou, 2021). In open-list PR systems, candidates must differentiate them-
selves from their co-partisans to be elected. Firstly, deviating from the party's median position may 
be a promising strategy to draw attention to oneself and to establish a unique personal reputation 
(Carey & Shugart, 1995; van Erkel, 2021). Secondly, the literature on intraparty competition also 
indicates that preference voting undermines the ideological and policy cohesion of parties (Kitschelt 
& Smyth, 2002; Carey, 2007; Crisp et al., 2013; Catalinac, 2018), suggesting that candidates adopting 
distinct policy positions will be more electorally successful than their moderate co-partisans. Thirdly, 
candidates who deviate from the party line may attract voters who do not agree with the party platform 
on some ideological dimensions (van Erkel, 2021). In a fragmented party system, this strategy can 
also attract voters from other parties. In open-list PR systems particularly, where voters are allowed 
to vote for candidates from more than one party, deviating from the party's median position can be 
an effective way to attract supporters from other parties. This tendency towards centrifugal intraparty 
competition  is  also  enhanced  by  the  incentives  for  parties  to  nominate  candidates  with  diverging 
opinions in order to broaden their electoral appeal (Kitschelt & Smyth, 2002). However, diverging too 
far from the party line may drive voters away (van Erkel, 2021). Strong party supporters can punish 
‘niche’ candidates for not following the party line, by voting for more moderate candidates in the same 
party. They can also punish the entire party list in which extreme deviating candidates stand.

Additionally, we know from the literature that electoral systems affect incentives for candidates' 
and parties' ideological position-taking in interparty competition—that is, competition among parties 
or among candidates of different parties (Cox, 1990; Magar et al., 1998; Dow, 2001, 2011; Merrill 
and Adams, 2002; Ezrow, 2008; Catalinac, 2018; Martin & Hug, 2020). The literature on interparty 
competition leads to alternative expectations about how candidates' ideological position-taking strate-
gies affect their electoral success under different intraparty voting procedures. Of course, there is one 
important difference between interparty and intraparty competition, which we take into account in our 
analyses: while there are no limits in the ideological range of candidates in interparty competition, 
deviating too far from the party line may drive voters away (Katz, 1980). According to this literature 
on interparty competition, the degree to which electoral systems create centrifugal and centripetal 
incentives for candidates to compete is affected by the electoral formula, the ballot structure (number 
and type of votes each voter is allowed to cast), district magnitude, and the number of competitors 
(Cox, 1990).

In open-list PR systems, seats are first distributed among parties according to one of the different 
PR formulas. All of them then use the plurality rule to allocate list seats in intraparty multi-member 
contests: those candidates with the largest number of preference votes are elected for the seats their 
party won. However, open-list PR systems differ in terms of the number of preference votes electors 
are allowed to cast, the constituency magnitude, and the number of competitors. In most of these 
systems (such as the Finnish one), voters are asked to cast a single preference vote; in others, voters 
are permitted to cast several preference votes. The bloc vote (voters have as many preference votes 
as there are seats in the district) with accumulation system (voters can give more than one preference 
vote to a candidate) is used in Luxembourg and Switzerland (Lower House elections). In Switzerland, 
voters are also allowed to cross-out candidates' names on party pre-printed ballots.

According  to  Cox  (1990),  office-seeking  candidates  position  themselves  differently  in  plural-
ity multi-member contests depending on the number and type of votes voters are allowed to cast. 
In multi-member districts which combine the plurality rule with a single vote per voter, ideologi-
cal competition will be centrifugal, candidates adopting dispersed positions across the ideological

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

spectrum (Cox, 1990). The underlying argument is that a larger district magnitude than the number 
of votes per voter will produce more competitors, who will avoid bunching together because of the 
disadvantages of being at the centre of the ideological spectrum (Catalinac, 2018). If we translate 
Cox's first proposition into intraparty multi-member contests with the plurality rule and a single pref-
erence  vote  per  voter,  candidates  who  deviate  from  their  party's  median  ideological  position  will 
receive more  preference votes than their party colleagues positioned closer to the median position.

On the other hand, in multi-member districts that combine the plurality rule with a bloc vote per 
voter, the ideological competition among candidates will be centripetal, converging on a centrally 
located position (Cox, 1990). If we translate Cox's second proposition into intraparty contests with 
the plurality rule and a bloc vote per voter, candidates who (slightly) deviate from their party's median 
ideological  position  will  receive  fewer  preference  votes  than  their  party  colleagues  at  the  centre 
of their party's position. According to Cox (1990), where accumulation is allowed in bloc voting 
systems, centrifugal forces will always dominate. However, if, under the bloc plurality vote, voters are 
allowed to cross-out candidates' names on the ballot, incentives for centrifugal competition resulting 
from accumulation can be compensated by electoral costs resulting from the deletion of candidates' 
names. The tendency for centripetal intraparty competition is further supported by the fact that public 
divisions or confrontations among a party's candidates may negatively affect voters' assessments of 
the party's policy competencies and decrease voters' support for that party (Greene & Haber, 2015).
Previous empirical evidence does not support the translation of Cox's first proposition into intra-
party contests. In elections to the Finnish Eduskunta, the plurality rule with a single preference vote 
per voter is used to allocate seats among a party's candidates. The limited empirical evidence, based 
on  Finnish  elections,  outlines  that  candidates  located  closer  to  their  party's  median  position  have 
greater electoral success than their co-partisans deviating from it (Isotalo et al., 2020; von Schoultz & 
Papageorgiou, 2021). Isotalo et al. (2020) also investigated whether the effect of candidates' ideologi-
cal distance is contingent upon their party's ideological position. The authors based their expectations 
on the directional model of ideological competition developed by Rabinowitz and Macdonald (1989). 
Consequently, Isotalo et al. argued that candidates in left-wing parties will enjoy an electoral advan-
tage by positioning themselves further to the left of their party line. On the other hand, candidates 
within right-wing parties will enjoy an electoral advantage by positioning themselves further to the 
right of their party line. These findings demonstrate that the direction of candidates distancing from 
their party lines matters, but only for centrist, right-wing, and close to ‘TAN’ positions parties. Cox's 
second proposition has not been tested empirically in intraparty competition under an open-list PR 
system with bloc preference voting. The work by van Erkel (2021), based on the Belgian flexible-list 
PR system with bloc preference voting, indicates that candidates positioned close to their parties' 
stance are more successful than their party colleagues deviating from the party line. However, accord-
ing to van Erkel, the ideological positioning of candidates (measured as either the absolute or direc-
tional distance) has no significant impact on their electoral outcomes.

Following these arguments, we will test our second hypothesis:

H2: In open-list PR systems with bloc preference voting, candidates holding policy posi-
tions similar to their party's median position will receive more preference votes than 
their party colleagues who deviate from the party line.

THE SWISS ELECTORAL SYSTEM

Since 1963, the Swiss National Council has been composed of 200 members: 194 MPs are elected 
in 22 PR multi-member constituencies and six are elected in plurality single member districts. The 
number of seats to be distributed in the multi-member districts has ranged from two to 35. Voters 
are given as many votes as there are seats to be filled in their respective districts. They are allowed 
to vote for candidates of more than one party and to accumulate two votes on the same candidate in

multi-member districts. Voters can choose between blank and pre-printed party ballot papers (Selb & 
Lutz, 2015). Voters must fill out blank ballots or alter pre-printed party ballots by handwriting, and 
they are allowed to cross out or add candidate's names (from other parties) on a pre-printed ballot. 
They are also allowed to write a candidate's name twice on the ballot and candidate's names can be 
listed twice on pre-printed ballots. Around 65 per cent of Swiss voters choose to alter pre-printed party 
ballots (Däubler et al., 2021).

Seats are first distributed among party lists according to the total number of votes they receive. 
Electoral  lists  can  be  combined  or  sub-combined  with  other  lists  for  the  allocation  of  seats  at  the 
constituency level.2 Most political parties field several lists (combined or sub-combined) in the same 
constituency, which results in a large number of candidates standing for election. Within each list, the 
regular practice is that political parties nominate as many candidates as there are seats in the district. 
Parties use different methods to order their candidates on each electoral list: party ordering, alphabeti-
cal ordering, or a combination of both (Lutz, 2010). The practice of ranking the candidates varies across 
the party lists in the same district and across districts. The Hagenbach-Bischoff quota with the highest 
remainders is used to allocate seats among party lists. Preference votes entirely determine the allocation 
of seats among candidates within each party list. Finally, voting is optional in Switzerland, resulting in 
one of the lowest turnout rates in national elections among established democracies (below 50 per cent 
since 1979; International IDEA, 2022). This electoral setting creates strong incentives for candidates to 
cultivate a personal vote in both interparty and intraparty competition (Selb & Lutz, 2015).

DATA, VARIABLES AND METHODS

One of the contributions of this paper is that in order to test the hypotheses, we built up a unique 
dataset which combines candidate survey data from the Comparative Candidates Survey (CCS) with 
individual candidates' and parties' electoral data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Over 47 per 
cent of the candidates standing for the last two elections to the National Council were interviewed in 
the CCS: 1,754 in 2015 and 2,131 in 2019. Keeping in mind our purposes, we restricted the candidate 
survey dataset in three important ways. Firstly, we took into account candidates standing in multi-member 
constituencies. Secondly, we narrowed the dataset to candidates from parties that achieved parliamen-
tary representation in either 2015 or 2019 (Table 1). Thirdly, we limited the dataset to candidates from 
parties with eight or more interviewed candidates in the same district. These three conditions narrowed 
the number of candidates in the dataset to 2,920: 1,243 in 2015 and 1,677 in 2019 (Table 1). Table 1 
offers an overview of the number of candidates competing and of the interviewed candidates per party 
in 2015 and 2019. Table 2 compares some personal characteristics of competing candidates, in terms 
of sex, age and incumbency, with those of the candidates interviewed in the CCS. With the exception 
of the overrepresentation of women in the 2015 survey, there are no significant deviations between the 
characteristics of the interviewed candidates and the candidates who stood for election.

Our dependent variable was the electoral success of candidates in intraparty competition, meas-
ured as their individual preference vote share. To calculate our dependent variable, the number of pref-
erence votes for a candidate was divided by the total number of preference votes cast for candidates 
from his/her electoral list in the district. This measure allowed us to compare the electoral success 
of candidates across districts and parties regardless of their respective party size.3 As the distribution 

2 Party lists may be combined with other lists for the same or different parties. Conversely, list sub-combinations must involve lists with the 
same basic name, the only difference being that each has candidates of a specific gender, wing of the same group, region, or age.
3 Under the Swiss open-list system, the casting of preference votes is not mandatory. Therefore, using the total number of votes cast for the 
party list as the reference point does not provide a standardized measure of candidates' electoral success across parties, as the number of 
preference votes cast for candidates within a party list varies across parties. Alternatively, using the total vote share of candidates (including 
preference votes and votes from unchanged ballots) makes no great difference. However, candidate names can be listed twice on pre-printed 
ballots. Candidates receive as many list votes as the number of times (up to two) they appear on a party list, but Swiss parties rarely use double 
nomination (Lutz, 2010).

Norris, 2016; König et al., 2017; Hooghe & Marks, 2018): the left–right economic conflict dimen-
sion and the GAL-TAN cultural value conflict dimension. The Swiss party system also reflects the 
two ideological dimensions (Oesch & Rennwald, 2010; Bornschier, 2015). Additionally, the 2019 
Swiss  national  elections  were  shaped  by  the  prominence  of  two  ‘unusual’  issues,  gender  and  the 
environment, whereas two issues key to Swiss politics, immigration and Europe, played a minor role 
compared to previous elections (Gilardi et al., 2022; Giger et al., 2022). We used candidates' survey 
answers to measure their positions on the two ideological scales. We performed exploratory factor 
analysis to build the two ideological dimensions by using selected CCS questions. Candidates had 
been asked to indicate whether they strongly agreed (1), agreed (2), disagreed (3) or strongly disa-
greed (4) with several issue statements regarding the economy, immigration, the environment, gender 
equality, same-sex marriage, abortion, and the EU. Exploratory factor analysis allowed us to reduce 
the information pertaining to all the variables present in our databases to two constructs that corre-
sponded to the two latent ideological dimensions (left–right and GAL-TAN). The analysis was carried 
out with SPSS 25 software, using the principal component reduction technique and VARIMAX rota-
tion for the selection of variables. For this purpose, the variables were grouped according to their 
factorial weights (Table 3) into two dimensions. Subsequently, we carried out a Bartlett correlation 
test to verify the correlation between the selected variables for each dimension.

We then calculated the final fit of the model. Firstly, we assessed the reliability (or consistency) 
of the selected variables for each factor using the Cronbach's alpha test. In all cases, Cronbach's alpha 
was significant with a value above 0.8. Subsequently, we calculated the adjustment indices for the 
final model, specifically the CFI (0.976 for 2015, 0.912 for 2019) and RMSEA (0.08 for 2015, 0.09 
for 2019), all presenting adequate adjustment values.4 Finally, we calculated candidates' factor scores 
according to the regression score method. The mean value of each score was as close as possible to 
0.0, and standard deviations were close to 1.0. Figures 1 and 2 offer an overview of the distribution 
of candidates per party on the two ideological dimensions compared to the overall distribution in 
2015 and 2019. They show that parties can be clearly positioned according to the distribution of their 
candidates' positions on the two ideological scales, but parties are not homogeneous actors. On the 
left–right dimension, for example, Figures 1 and 2 indicate that most of the candidates from left-wing 
parties (SPS, GPS, PdA, EVP) are on the left, while candidates from right-wing parties (SVP, FDP) 
are mostly to the right. Candidates from centrist parties (CVP, GLP) are mostly at the centre. However, 

4 The goodness-of-fit index (GFI) is an index of the amount of variability explained by the model. Its values   range between 0 (poor fit) and 1 
(perfect fit). Values   above 0.90 are considered to indicate an acceptable model fit. The most robust goodness-of-fit index proposed is the root 
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). This index has been developed as an absolute measure of the difference in the structure of 
relationships between the proposed model and the covariance values   in the measured population.

there are extreme candidates on both sides of their party line compared to the median distribution. 
Figures 1 and 2 also illustrate that interparty and intraparty differences on the left–right dimension are 
also greater than on the GAL-TAN scale.

To operationalize the positions of candidates with respect to their parties more accurately, we first 
used the average score for a party's candidates to represent the party position on the two ideological 
dimensions. This procedure has been used in previous studies as a valid indication of the official party 
line (Isotalo et al., 2020; van Erkel, 2021). In the Swiss case, we calculated parties' candidates' median 
position at both the national and cantonal (or district) level. These two alternative levels of calculation 
relied on two considerations: firstly, the Swiss party system is territorially fragmented at the cantonal 
level despite recent trends toward its nationalization (Bochsler, 2019); and secondly, intraparty compe-
tition occurs at the cantonal or constituency level, and, therefore, candidates of the same party compete 
against each other at the constituency level, and not at the national level. Next, we used two alter-
native measures of candidates' distance in relation to their parties: absolute distance and directional 
distance. Absolute distance takes the absolute value of the difference between the score of candidates 
and their party score. Directional distance was calculated by subtracting the position of candidates from 
their party's median position. Directional distance takes into account that the direction of candidates' 
distancing on the two ideological dimensions (more to the left/right, more GAL-TAN) may affect their 
electoral success differently. Additionally, following Isotalo et al. (2020), in order to control for the

F I G U R E   1   Overview of ideological distributions of candidates on the Left–Right dimension in 2015 and 2019.  
Note: The graphs show the distribution of the scores of all the electorate (light area) and each political party's voters (dark 
area) on the Left–Right dimension/scale. Source: own elaboration based on data from the CCS.

direction of distance effects, we split the distance of candidates with respect to their party's median 
position into two categories on each dimension. On the left–right dimension, we differentiated left 
distance (if the candidate was more leftist than the respective party's median position) and right distance 
(if the candidate was more rightist than the party's median position). On the GAL-TAN dimension, we 
distinguished GAL distance (if the candidate was situated below the party's median position on the 
cultural dimension) and TAN distance (if the candidate was situated above the party's median position 
on it). Next, we classified the parties on the two ideological dimensions. We grouped the parties into 
three categories on the left–right dimension: left-wing if their mean candidate position was below −0.5 
points; right-wing if their mean candidate position was above 0.5 points; centre for parties with medi-
ans between −0.5 and 0.5 points. We developed the same procedure for the GAL-TAN dimension.5

We also considered as independent variables the personal attributes of candidates, which could 
affect their election chances more than their ideological positions. These included gender, age, whether 
candidates  were  incumbents,  whether  they  had  electoral,  party,  and  public  office  experience,  and 
localness. Gender and age have been shown to have no consistent effects on the electoral success of 
candidates in intraparty competition (Wauters et al., 2010; Kunovich, 2012; Valdini, 2012; Spierings & 
Jacobs, 2014; Allik, 2015; Marcinkiewicz & Stegmaier, 2015; Mustillo & Polga-Hecimovich, 2020). 
Conversely, we expected incumbency, prior electoral, party and public office experience, and local-
ness to be an advantage for candidates in intraparty competition (Dahlgaard, 2016; Jankowski, 2016).

5 However, the direction of distance effects on the electoral success of candidates in intraparty competition was not statistically significant.

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

2015

2019

F I G U R E   2   Overview of ideological distributions of candidates on the GAL-TAN dimension in 2015 and 2019.  
Note: The graphs show the distribution of the scores of all the electorate (light area) and each political party's voters (dark 
area) on the GAL-TAN dimension/scale. Source: own elaboration based on data from the CCS.

We coded gender as “1” for women and “0” for men, and we measured candidates' age in decades. 
Additionally, we included the squared term of age to capture a possible inverse U-curved effect. Incum-
bency is a dummy variable, coded as “1” for those candidates who were elected in the previous election 
or were MPs in the previous legislature, and “0” otherwise. We used several binary indicators to meas-
ure electoral, party and political experience (“1” for candidates with experience and “0” otherwise): (1) 
electoral experience in federal elections (for either the Upper or Lower Houses, coded as “0” for candi-
dates standing for their first time); (2) party office experience at the regional and federal levels; (3) 
local political experience as a local councillor, member of the local government or city council major; 
(4) and regional (cantonal) political experience as a regional parliamentarian or member of the regional 
government. Additionally, living in the district may be beneficial for candidates running for election. 
We thus operationalized ‘localness’ as a scaled variable measuring the number of years a candidate 
had been living in the constituency with respect to her/his age, ranging from “0” (for candidates having 
never lived in the district they ran in) to “1” (for candidates living their whole life in that district).

Finally, we considered as control variables three characteristics of party lists in which each candi-
date appears. Firstly, we considered the position of an individual candidate on her/his electoral list, 
measured on a scale ranging from “0” (for the first candidate) to “1” (for the last candidate), given 
that the number of competing candidates varies from one list to another. In order to capture a possi-
ble  inverse  J-shaped  effect  of  the  ballot  position,  we  also  included  its  quadratic  term  (Söderlund 
et al., 2021). Secondly, we considered list length, which is related to district magnitude, and meas-
ures the number of candidates running from the party list of each candidate. Thirdly, list support

In our dataset, candidates (level 1) are nested in lists (level 2) within parties (level 3) in specific 
districts (level 4)6 and across elections (2015–2019). Therefore, multilevel or mixed linear regres-
sion was considered to be the most appropriate method of analysis (Heck et al., 2014). We ran five 
multi-level  linear  regression  models  with  the  log  transformation  of  preference  vote  share  as  the 
dependent variable to test our hypotheses on the effect of candidates' ideological position and personal 
attributes on their intraparty electoral success.
RESULTS

We generated several regression models considering different sets of variables. Model 1 includes only 
our control variables (ballot position of candidates, their list length, and the percentage of total votes 
cast for their party list), for the purpose of comparison with subsequent models. Model 2 adds the abso-
lute distance of candidates with respect to their party's median position on the two ideological dimen-
sions. Model 3 additionally includes variables related to the personal attributes of candidates. Model 4 
combines variables on personal attributes and ideological positions of candidates. Model 5 introduces 
the directional distance of candidates as an alternative to their absolute distance on the two ideological 
dimensions, also controlling for their respective party's median positions.7 The regression coefficient 
results of the five multilevel models are shown in Table 4 and the average marginal effects in Figure 3.
In Model 1 and in subsequent models in Table 4, all our control variables were statistically signif-
icant. Candidates' ballot position has a J-shaped effect on their preference vote share. Additionally, 
and as could be expected, the length and size of candidates' party lists are negatively correlated with 
their vote winning, as the preference vote share each candidate receives decreases as both the number 
of co-partisan candidates on their party list and the total electoral support for their list increase at 
the district level. The results from Model 2 initially and partially support our expectations. Firstly, 
as  shown  in Table  4,  the  ideological  position  of  candidates  has  a  small  effect  on  their  respective 
preference vote share, as indicated by the improvement of model fit indices (AIC and BIC) and the 
increase in the value of R 2 from Model 1 to Model 2. Secondly, the position of candidates on the left–
right scale has a small effect on their electoral success in intraparty competition but it is nevertheless 
significant. Candidates deviating from their national party's median policy positions on the left–right 
scale receive slightly fewer preference votes than their party colleagues who are closer to them, as 
illustrated in Figure 4. Conversely, the ideological position of candidates on the GAL-TAN dimension 
is not statistically significant when explaining their preference vote share.

Model 3 includes the personal attributes of candidates, also controlling for their ballot position, 
the list length, and the percentage of the total votes cast for their party list. As the results from Model 
3 show, candidates' personal attributes have a statistically significant impact on their respective pref-
erence vote share; the impact seems to be stronger than that of their ideological position, as indicated 
by the increase in the value of R 2 and model fit indices compared to Models 1 and 2. The coeffi-
cients in Model 3 indicate that females, incumbents, and candidates with electoral, party and public 
office experience receive more preference votes than their male party colleagues, newcomers, and 
candidates without experience. Age has a curvilinear effect on preference vote share: preference vote 
share increases with the age of candidates until up to the late twenties (29 years old) and tends to 
decrease with age for older candidates. Localness, measured as the ratio of candidates' years living in 
the  district with respect to their age, is positively associated with preference vote share.

6 We ran four-level linear regression models, as Swiss parties usually field several electoral lists in the same district. Additionally, we ran 
cross-classified models, where candidates were nested within lists in a cross-classified combination of parties and districts. However, the 
respective results do not diverge.
7 In models 2, 4, and 5, the party's median position at the national level was used as the reference point for calculating the ideological distance 
of candidates on the two ideological dimensions. We also ran multilevel regression analysis, where our two main independent variables were 
calculated on the basis on the party's median position at district level. However, results were not statistically significant and are not displayed here.

F I G U R E   3   Average marginal effects of candidates' personal attributes, and ideological positions on their preference 
vote share in 2015 and 2019 Swiss National Council elections.

Model 4 combines both sets of variables. It supports our previous findings regarding the relative 
importance of both candidates' personal attributes and their ideological position, and the robustness of 
our analyses. It confirms our Hypothesis 1: the results from Model 4 indicate that candidates' personal 
attributes have a stronger effect on their electoral success than their ideological position. Model 4 
improved  model  fit  indices  (AIC  and  BIC),  and  the  increase  in  the  value  of  R 2  was  0.03  points 
compared to Model 3. The results from Model 4 partially confirm our Hypothesis 2: they indicate that 
deviating from the respective party line has a small and negative impact on candidates' preference vote 
share, but the effect of candidates' ideological position is only significant on the left–right dimension.
To better understand the magnitude of the effects of candidates' ideological position and their personal 
attributes on preference vote share, we present (Figure 5) the marginal effects of significant predictors, 
all other independent variables included in Model 4 being held constant. Following the methodological 
choice of von Schoultz and Papageorgiou (2021) for the absolute distance of candidates on the left–right 
dimension, the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3) were used as anchor points. Figure 5 indicates that 
not all variables included in Model 4 have an equal impact on preference vote share. Moving from a party 
moderate position (Q1) to more deviating party position (Q3) decreases preference vote share by 0.2 
percentage points. This can be compared to the marginal effect of incumbency. Being an incumbent has 
a positive effect of 7.6 percentage points on preference vote share. The attributes of candidates related 
to public office experience have more modest effects on their preference vote share. Political experience 
at the regional and local levels increases preference vote share by 1.8 and 0.6 percentage points, respec-
tively. Being a woman has a positive effect of 0.5 percentage points on the preference vote share.

Coming back to our second research question (and H2), the results from Models 2 and 4 indicate 
that deviating from the party line has a negative effect on vote winning, but this is only significant 
on the left–right dimension. There are two possible explanations for these results. Firstly, intraparty

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

F I G U R E   4   Left–Right distance of candidates and preference vote share in 2015 and 2019 Swiss National Council 
elections.

differences on the left–right dimension are greater than on the GAL-TAN dimension, as illustrated in 
Figures 1 and 2. Secondly, although the Swiss party system experienced relevant changes in the last 
electoral processes, the left–right dimension may still be considered the dominant one for electoral 
competition, whereas the GAL-TAN cultural dimension might be more relevant for non-conventional 
political participation (Oesch & Rennwald, 2010; Bornschier, 2015).

In Model 5, we used the directional distance of candidates' positions as an alternative measure 
to their absolute distance on the two ideological dimensions to test the effects of candidates' ideo-
logical position on their electoral success in intraparty competition. Candidates that lean more to the 
right than their party's median position received (slightly) fewer preference votes than their party 
colleagues aligned with their party's median position. Conversely, the effect of leaning more to the 
left or below/above their party's median position on the GAL-TAN dimension does not statistically 
significantly  affect the preference vote share. The significant and negative effect of a candidate's more 
rightist position than the respective party's median could be explained by the polarized and multiparty 
Swiss system where a radical right party (SVP) is, by a large margin, the most voted for. In this context, 
leaning more to the right than the respective party position could be negatively perceived by voters. 
Additionally, in the 2015 and 2019 elections, parties focused their electoral campaign more on mobi-
lizing their own respective electorate than on attracting voters from other parties (Bernhard, 2020).

CONCLUSIONS

In most parliamentary elections in European democracies voters are allowed to show their preference 
(vote) for parties' candidates. Literature found evidence to support that candidates' personal attributes 
(such as gender, age, incumbency, and localness) have an effect on their electoral success in intraparty

political stance influences their success in intraparty competition has scarcely been explored.

This article contributes to the limited literature on the impact of candidates' ideological position on 
their intraparty electoral success by analysing the effect of candidates' personal attributes and political 
stance on intraparty competition in an open-list system with multiple preference votes. The Swiss 
open-list system constitutes an intraparty preference voting setting that creates strong incentives for 
candidates of the same party to compete against each other. In order to test our hypotheses, we used 
a unique dataset, built on the combination of candidate survey data (CCS) and the electoral results of 
individual candidates and their party, which had not been used before for these purposes.

Our results demonstrate that candidates' political stance (measured as the distance between their 
position  and  their  party's  median  on  the  left–right  and  GAL-TAN  dimensions)  has  a  statistically 
significant though small impact on their preference vote share. These findings are in accordance with 
the very few previous studies on the topic—the two works on the Finnish open-list system (Isotalo 
et al., 2020; von Schoultz and Papageorgiou, 2021). Candidates closer to their party's median position 
on the left–right dimension receive more preference votes than their party colleagues deviating from 
it. The distance of candidates on the GAL-TAN dimension has no statistically significant effect on 
their preference vote share. Conversely, candidates' personal attributes are of greater importance for 
their electoral intraparty success: female candidates receive more preference votes than their male 
party colleagues; incumbents and candidates with electoral, party or public office experience are also 
advantaged  in  intraparty  competition;  and  candidates'  localness  positively  affects  their  preference 
vote share. Our results are also partially in line with the findings of a study on the Belgian flexible-list 
system with bloc preference voting (van Erkel, 2021), which also showed that candidates not deviat-
ing from their party position receive more preference votes that those deviating from the party line,

THE IMPACT OF IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES 
OF CANDIDATES IN INTRAPARTY COMPETITION

but this effect was not statistically significant. One explanation for the different results in our study 
may be that ideological differences among a party's candidates are smaller in Belgium than in Swit-
zerland. Additionally, it should be considered that under the Belgian flexible system, the election of 
candidates is determined both by preference votes and party ordering of candidates, which incentiv-
izes candidates to follow the official party line in order to keep/advance their position on the party list 
in subsequent elections. This is not the case in Switzerland, where deviating from the party's stance 
might be more important than in Belgium for election purposes.

Besides its contribution to an underdeveloped topic in research, this article also contributes to the 
literature showing that, in contrast to what some literature on intraparty competition suggests, IPV 
does not undermine the ideological cohesion of parties by favouring intraparty centrifugal competi-
tion. Moderate party candidates (in line with their party positions) are more successful than their party 
competitors with more radical positions. Furthermore, ideological competition between candidates of 
the same party has a marginal impact on their electoral success, the effect of candidates' position on 
the ballot being stronger than ideological intraparty competition. A final contribution of this article 
is  that our results may have important implications for the linkages between voters, candidates and 
their parties, and for the behaviour of politicians concerning party discipline once they are elected.
